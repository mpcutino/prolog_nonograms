# Prolog and Nonograms

This repository contains a Prolog solution to the nonogram problem. Specifically, to those nonograms present on the CrossMeColors mobile application.

To use it, you just need to add a json file with the board information. Then change main.py to use the file you just created.

The python code is provided only for visualization, as it is easier to understand an image than a Prolog standard output. I use the term output although Prolog 
does not have and input/output concept. For this specific problem, it is just the way to indicating the predicate that it is used to save the final solutions.

Some examples are given to validate the output of our proposal.
